# Cloth-Image-Recognition
48 hours TAMU Aggies Invent project "CLO" A.K.A the "FashionID App"
One of the ten ideas selected out of over hundreds of entries
Recognizes picture of shirts and extract the dominant color of the shirt and the logo.
Data fed into the database that pulls out the matching shirts and stores from the database. 
"If you like it, Clo it "

Written using OpenCV with help of the Kmeans clusters algorithm by taking the colors in the 3D space with the maximum concentration as the dominant color. 
Implemented certain library functions in OpenCv that did not work well in Visual Studio. 
Further algorithm that recognizes patterns and other key features of the shirt is being developed.
